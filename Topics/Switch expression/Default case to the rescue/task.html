<p>Your new taste-tester app is coming along nicely, but as it grows larger, you and your team members need to add more and more foods to the taste <code class="java">enum</code>. Unfortunately, one of your team members is a bit forgetful and sometimes adds new items without adding/updating a case statement for them. Fill in the blank with a <code class="java">default</code> case statement so that your code will throw an <code class="java">Exception</code> with the message: "Reminder: please add your new items to a case statement." Use arrow syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="java">int tasteValue = switch (taste) {
    case SUGAR, PIZZA, CHOCOLATE -&gt; 10;
    case MEATBALLS, STEAK -&gt; 7;
    case BROCCOLI -&gt; 4;
    case DIRT -&gt; 1;
